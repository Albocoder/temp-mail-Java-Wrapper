# Java-API
This repository is a wrapper of temp-mail API for Java.
<hr>
Just released the first version(beta version)!!!<br> 
I'm open to any feedback and suggestion.<br>
While still a library exists this one is more focused towards efficiency and ease of use and of course for me to practise Java.<br>
#### [+] It is very robust simple and will blow your problems away<br>
<hr>
#### [-] THIS CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK! <br>
Since the guys of temp-mail have killed the old api and made a new one which requires authentication. It yet is not functional. Updates will come when everything is settled down.
